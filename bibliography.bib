	abstract = {Heating from the decay of radioactive nuclides in shutdown reactors plays an important role in the safety evaluation of nuclear power plants. It also must be known in order to design spent fuel storage systems, shutdown reactor cooling systems and heat sink, reprocessing and nuclear waste disposal systems. Of these applications, the analysis of reactor accident scenarios has been the main impetus to develop more accurate methods of decay heat evaluation. It was recognized early in the 1970s that the knowledge was inadequate for safety requirements and that this placed an economic burden on nuclear power plants. Intensive research has been undertaken in the past few years and this has led to a much more precise knowledge of decay heat power in Light Water Reactors (LWR). With additional work this improvement can soon be extended to other reactors types. This paper reviews the background, recent research developments and the evolution of a major revision of the American Nuclear Society Standard for decay heat power in LWR.},

	abstract = {Many aspects of the nuclear fuel cycle require accurate and detailed knowledge of the energy release rate from the decay of radioactive nuclides produced in an operating reactor. In addition to the safety assessment of nuclear power plant, decay heat estimates are needed for the evaluation of shielding requirements on fuel discharge and transport routes and for the safe management of radioactive waste products extracted from spent fuel during reprocessing. The decay heat estimates may be derived by either summation calculations or Standard equations. This paper reviews the development of these evaluation methods and traces their evolution since the first studies of the 1940s. In contrast to many of the previous reviews of this subject, both actinide and fission product evaluation methods are reviewed in parallel. Data requirements for summation calculations are examined and a summary given of available codes and their data libraries. The capabilities of present-day summation methods are illustrated through comparisons with available experimental results. Uncertainties in summation results are examined in terms of those in the basic nuclear data, irradiation details and method of calculation. The evolution of decay heat Standards is described and a brief examination made of their reliability and ability to provide suitably conservative decay heat estimates. Finally, to illustrate the use of present summation methods, comparisons are given of both the actinide and fission product decay heat levels from typical fuel samples in a variety of reactor systems.},
